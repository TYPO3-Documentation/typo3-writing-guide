typo3.org Content Contribution
==============================

It doesn’t matter if you are a writer or not. Anyone can submit content
or an idea for content on typo3.org, including events, news, tutorials,
blogs, and more.

.. _1-the-content-group:

The Content Group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Content Group facilitates content creation for typo3.org, but they
don’t write everything. They rely on members of the community to help
create content, and the team helps write, proofread, translate, and
publish content for the TYPO3 community.

.. _2-submit-a-content-request-form:

Submit a content request form
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To submit content, log in to your my.typo3.org account and fill out
the\ `Content Request
Form <https://typo3.org/community/teams/communication-coordination/content-request>`__\ .
Try to submit this form as soon as you have a budding idea, so it can be
added to the publication schedule—submitting early gives other
contributors more time and leeway to help out.

The form lists various categories for content submissions, like:

-  Event Promotion
-  Event Report
-  Team Report
-  Development News
-  General Content (e.g., tutorials)
-  Review
-  Interview
-  Other

You can also indicate what sort of help you might need, including:

-  Proofreading (included by default)
-  Translating
-  Writing
-  Improving/Copy editing

Suggest a title, author, and summarize the main message of the content.
We’ll also ask you to identify the main audience of your content, such
as:

-  TYPO3 community in general
-  Developers
-  Agencies
-  End customers
-  End users
-  Outsiders

Identify a “call-to-action”—the action you want readers to take after
reading the content. It’s often as simple as redirecting the reader to
another area on the website or asking them to get in touch. Optionally
include images or ideas for images. Both calls-to-action and images help
enliven an article.

.. _3-track-content-with-trello:

Track Content with Trello
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Content Group uses a\ `public Trello
board <https://trello.com/b/QrnBfQyK/typo3-content-this-is-a-public-board>`__\ to
track content workflows.

When you complete the\ `Content Request
Form <https://typo3.org/community/teams/communication-coordination/content-request>`__\ ,
a card is automatically generated on the board. It starts in the
‘Content requests’ column.

Trello cards have a checklist to ensure each piece of content has
standard elements, including:

-  Link to the working document
-  A header image
-  A meta description
-  A social message
-  Newsletter blurb

Make sure they’re all appropriately filled in. Once you begin a piece of
content, the Trello tasks move from left to right across the columns on
the Trello board:

#. Content requests
#. Content in progress
#. Needs a review or proofreading
#. Reviewed and returned to author
#. Ready to publish
#. Published & ready for next newsletter

There is also a column for ‘Blocked’ content.

.. _4-meetings-and-slack-channel:

Meetings and Slack channel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Content Group meets every second week and discusses the status of
cards on the Trello board, as well as new content requests.

We use our Slack
channel\ `#t3a-content-group <https://typo3.slack.com/archives/CJ87LCKT9>`__\ to
tag content authors or submitters to keep them apprised of the status of
their content.

.. _5-newsletter:

Newsletter
~~~~~~~~~~

All content published on typo3.org is typically included in the TYPO3
Newsletter, which is sent out at the end of each month.
