Step 6: Approval
================

Once we have incorporated feedback, polished the language, and
implemented all necessary assets, the document should be ready for
approval. Get approval from any necessary stakeholders.

We often provide metadata (meta title and meta description) and draft
social media posts (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) with pieces of
content. Sometimes we provide images and screenshots. What to provide is
defined in the\ `Create a Trello
Card <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kaWoSm05SX-ZWGDkY9sEWb-1GWvDmfrNd_5pzPvUGaE/edit\#heading=h.96s8w0sd8nm5>`__\ section.

   | **Tip:** Quote approval and technical review are essential before
     publication but can happen at any stage in the process that makes
     sense for the people involved. Since context is everything, the
     quote source (or the lawyers!) might want to see the otherwise
     finished article before they approve their quote.
