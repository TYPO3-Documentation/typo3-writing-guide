Editing Codes
=============

As part of the authentic communication framework, we have a collection
of short editing marks, or codes, that we use to identify a specific
writing guideline and communicate the rationale behind a suggested edit.
They are organized into four structural sections (and several
sub-sections) that help scan, parse, and process a piece we’re editing
in a structured, consistent way:

-  A. Scope & Narrative Structure
-  B. Flow & Readability
-  C. Style & Phrasing
-  D. Choice of Words

See the `Editing Codes and their
guidelines <https://drive.google.com/file/d/162WkmcX46y_quFJl9qI0SeZ8Bc3NSQHh/view\?usp=sharing>`__.

When editing someone’s work, the first “positivity” pass we take is to
mark things we like with “++” and the relevant code (e.g. ++CRISP):
colorful word choices, solid writing, use of our principles. This
specific praise reinforces positive aspects, which builds trust. It also
reminds writers and editors to keep these pieces when making changes
later in the process.

In later passes, we use the pure codes (without “++”) to mark sections
that we are changing or that need changing. For example, ACRO is a code
about word choice, reminding the writer and editor to explain an
acronym. Beyond the simple code, we strive to add a compact explanation
of what we see and why it needs changing.

Writing and creativity are always subjective. We strive to avoid
good/bad binary thinking and judgments. When making suggestions and
changes to someone else’s writing, we don’t talk about “wrong” and
“corrected” or “fixed” text. We say things like “original” and
“updated”, or “your text” and “my suggestion.”
