Style and Phrasing
==================

.. _1-make-each-word-count:

Make each word count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As writer Frank Conroy once said, “The goal isn’t brevity for its own
sake but clarity.” You don’t have limitless space. Make your words
count.

**Don’t use ten words if you can use five. “**\ That” can generally be
cut. Sometimes “with” or “of” can, too. Look out for filler terms like
“at your fingertips” and cliché tech terms, like “disruptive”

-  **Before:** TYPO3 puts the support, flexibility, and features you
   need at your fingertips so you can start high-value projects quickly.
-  **After:** Launch projects quickly with TYPO3’s flexible,
   feature-rich Core and 24/7 support.
-  **Before:** TYPO3 is a CMS that has a developer focus
-  **After: TYPO3 is a developer-focused CMS**

**Go light on adjectives**. As a general rule: verb > noun > adjective.
Verbs and nouns describe without going overboard.

-  **Before:** TYPO3’s streamlined, efficient, disruptive CMS is great
   and easy for busy, hard-working content editors.
-  **After:** TYPO3 CMS’s workflows and editing tools save content
   editors time.

.. _2-use-active-verbs-often:

Use active verbs often
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Replace passive verbs with active verbs** to clarify actions and
meanings. Look out for “are,” “was,” and “be” followed by a past
participle ending (often ending in “-ed.”)

**Tip: Recognize passive constructions.** They usually fail to mention
“who” is acting, so you are left asking, “The action was done by whom?”

-  **Before:** A content element can be moved, copied for reuse, and
   deleted.
-  **After:** You can copy, reuse, move, and delete content elements.
-  **Before:** Once our solution was implemented ...
-  **After:** Once we implemented the solution ...

**Gerunds.** Check if gerunds (phrases that end in -ing) are weakening
your message.

-  **Before:** “\ *Creating* an adequate content strategy template is a
   helpful tool for *planning* your content.”
-  **After:** Create a content strategy template to plan your content.

**Replace helper verbs with more precise, active verbs.** Look for
“has”, “does”, “gives”, “stays”, or “keeps” + a noun for candidates.

-  **Before:** “TYPO3 gives marketers the tools they need to keep
   simplifying the many decisions they have to make on a daily basis.”
-  **After:** TYPO3’s tools simplify your marketing team’s daily
   decisions.

..

   **Bonus tip: This is an English-language thing.** While we frown on
   passive constructions in English, they are perfectly acceptable in
   many other languages. Keep this in mind when working with materials
   translated from another language.

.. _3-be-specific:

Be Specific
~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the most specific version of a word or phrase. Don’t generalize or
be vague. Write about the technology or product at hand, rather than
technology or the internet as a whole.

**Highlight words unique to the product, company, or persona.** If
reading something in isolation, could it apply to any or many
technologies? If yes, try to make it more specific to your subject.

-  **Before:** TYPO3 CMS was designed to support enterprises with the
   effective tools, systems, and frameworks they need.
-  **After:** TYPO3 CMS supports enterprises with a User Access
   Management system, 24/7 support teams, and centralized Digital Asset
   Management.

**Watch out for filler words** used in tech-speak, like “efficient”,
“streamlined. ” Replace them with more specific, results-based phrases
like “speeds up deployment” or “saves editors time.”

-  **Before:** Get streamlined workflows that are customizable for
   editors’ and publishers’ needs.
-  **After:** Customize workflows to match your internal editing and
   approval process.

.. _4-write-professionally-and-clearly:

Write professionally and clearly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Grammar, spelling, style, and tone should be professional and correct.
Generally, you should try to adapt tone and style to the context,
target, or channel.

**Avoid overly casual language** that sounds more conversational than
written.

-  **Before:** TYPO3 makes really great stuff for developer-type people.
-  **After:** TYPO3 is made for developers.

**But don’t be too stuffy…** our friendly, open personality should still
shine through.

-  **Before:** Review testimonials from our satisfied customers.
-  **After:** Hear from our satisfied customers.

**Be positive.** Rather than criticize competitors, frame the challenges
that the product or organization is trying to solve—and highlight how
they do it well. (We don’t
do\ `FUD <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt>`__\ or
negative copy.)

-  **Before:** Many content management systems come with a high risk of
   security vulnerabilities. TYPO3 keeps your installation protected
   with advanced security practices upheld by a dedicated team, and a
   great developer experience, and a community of 500+ contributors to
   boot.
-  **After:** Keeping your website secure should always be top of mind.
   TYPO3 has industry-beating low numbers of vulnerabilities, and a
   dedicated, vigilant security team.

.. _5-be-compelling:

Be Compelling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Use interesting, bright verbs and noun**\ s.\ `OneLook
Thesaurus <https://onelook.com/thesaurus>`__\ is a great resource.

-  **Before:** TYPO3 helps agencies create digital value.
-  **After:** Agencies thrive when they use TYPO3.

**Write headlines that grab attention.** Try alliterations, varying
rhythm, metaphors, etc.

-  **Example Article Header Before:**

   -  The Product X feature set focuses on community

-  **Example Article Headers After:**

   -  Community-Focused Features: The Product X story
   -  The (funded) future of Product X

Look for ideas and inspiration from around the web. Feel free to borrow
sentence structures from well-known brands.

-  **Example from Mailchimp:** “Marketing smarts for big ideas.”
-  **Similar sentence structure:** “Security software for peace of
   mind.“

.. _6-bring-prose-to-life-with-figurative-language:

Bring prose to life with figurative language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Figurative language can add life, color, and depth of meaning to complex
or dry concepts. It will express nuance or demonstrate real and tangible
qualities that plainer language might struggle to convey. Some common
examples are:

-  **Simile:** Saying something is like something else (e.g., “Computer
   Malware can spread like a virus.”)
-  **Metaphor:** Saying something is something else (e.g., “Malware is a
   virus that preys on software.”)
-  **Analogy:** Saying something is like something else to make an
   explanatory point. (e.g., “Not all malware is business-critical. Some
   malware is simply annoying and time-consuming, like a common cold is
   to the human body.”)

Technical writing is full of figurative language. Common phrases like
computer bugs, patch releases, front-end caches all come from other
references (in this case, illness, clothes mending, and storage) and
help clarify meaning.

.. _7-general-guidelines-for-figurative-language:

General Guidelines for figurative language
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  **Language should be universally understood:** Since much of our
   content is translated, we strive to use translatable, region-agnostic
   metaphors. Avoid cultural references, idioms, and colloquialisms that
   could be meaningless or offensive in other cultures—e.g., “He was a
   Benedict Arnold.”
-  **Use figurative language to clarify complex concepts.** Extended
   metaphors can help simplify concepts. Always explain the concept in
   real terms using plain language, either preceding or following the
   metaphor. Never rely solely on metaphors for understanding. (See
   this `primer on
   containers <https://increment.com/containers/primer-on-containerization/>`__ for
   an example of an excellent extended analogy using “bricks and
   architects.”)
-  **Use analogies to help make raw or dull data more interesting** and
   help people visualize it. For example, (from chapter 19 of
   \\\\\ `\\\Everybody Writes\\\\\ by Ann
   Handley) <https://annhandley.com/everybodywrites/>`__

   -  That\'s enough cable to go to the moon and back three times,
   -  That\'s enough electricity to power the city of New York for a
      week.

-  **Compare objects with natural connections or inherent
   similarities**, like a garden and a customer base, that both grow:
   “Consistent customer communications are like watering your garden.”
-  **Use metaphorical language sparingly**: Too many or mixed metaphors
   can overwhelm readers and obfuscate rather than clarify. Try to limit
   yourself to one or two usages per article.
-  **When in doubt, go with simple language.** Not everything requires a
   metaphor, simile, or analogy. Use figurative language only when it
   adds life, color, or depth to your piece, never at the expense of
   clarity.

.. _8-use-non-violent-language:

Use non-violent language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We aim to use non-violent language because:

-  **We communicate to connect.** Non-violent language helps create and
   strengthen connections. Violent language separates, categorizes, and
   destroys.
-  **We focus on bringing value** to customers by understanding their
   needs and solving their problems compellingly and uniquely. War
   metaphors are not only cliché and tired; they also reflect negative,
   outdated strategies (as outlined in this piece by Frank V.
   Cespedes, `Stop Using Battle Metaphors in Your Company
   Strategy <https://hbr.org/2014/12/stop-using-battle-metaphors-in-your-company-strategy>`__ ).
-  **Collaboration, creativity, and diversity are important** for most
   organizations today. Culture is central to that, and a significant
   component of culture is how we communicate. Non-violent language
   helps immensely.

We use non-violent language by replacing metaphors around war with
other, more peaceful, constructive ones like art, carpentry, and
gardening. For inspiration, check out `The Language of Peace:
Constructing Non-Violent
Metaphors <http://users.clas.ufl.edu/hardman/peace.html>`__ , notes
from a workshop by Dr. M.J. Hardman.

Examples

-  **Before:** head-to-head comparison
-  **After**: side-by-side comparison
-  **Before:** Translation support is a powerful weapon in your CMS
   arsenal.
-  **After**: Translation support is a powerful tool in your CMS
   toolkit.

.. _9-use-inclusive-language:

Use inclusive language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Be inclusive.** Our goal is to help readers feel respected and
welcomed. Inclusive language demonstrates empathy for readers.
Non-inclusive language shows prejudice, bias, discrimination, or a lack
of sensitivity. And as we said under `Use non-violent
language <https://docs.google.com/document/d/14Vm-UWcsgNXTadoRW9krXJk0PP0P4WTzOxtyklFrQo8/edit\#heading=h.2p2csry>`__ ,
“We communicate to connect.” Non-violent language helps create and
strengthen connections. Violent language separates, categorizes, and
destroys.

**Be respectful.** Ask people you are writing about how they prefer to
be identified and referred to. The UK National Institute for Health and
Care Excellence has a comprehensive guide to using “person-centered”
language in the `Talking about people
section <https://www.nice.org.uk/corporate/ecd1/chapter/talking-about-people-including-deaf-and-blind-age-faith-family-background-gender>`__ of
their style guide.

**Pronouns.** If you need to use pronouns throughout an article, balance
the use of she/her with he/him. We prefer to use a majority of she/her
instances. The singular “they” is also acceptable.

**Remove Bias.** We work to remove bias from our language. Inherent
biases around gender, race, religion, body types, and other issues are
often difficult to see in ourselves.

-  Buffer’s `Incomplete Guide to Inclusive
   Language <https://open.buffer.com/inclusive-language-tech/>`__ is a
   practical overview of some practices and principles.
-  You can test your implicit biases with this `Harvard
   tool <https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/takeatest.html>`__.

.. _10-address-readers-directly:

Address readers directly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Try to use “you” instead of “they” or the archetypal persona (e.g.,
“developers”).

The direct address makes people feel spoken to. Address your readers
where it makes sense throughout a blog post.

-  **Before:** The direct address makes people feel spoken to.
-  **After:** Speak to your readers, address them directly.
-  **Before:** Developers like Technology X because it makes deployment
   easier for them.
-  **After:** Technology X will make your deployments easier.

.. _11-dont-criticize:

Don’t criticize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Stay positive and constructive.** If you don’t know your readers’
context or circumstances, you can’t tell them, “you’re doing it wrong.”
Don’t tell them to be scared or worry. Likewise, don’t blame people for
the software or systems they might have inherited along the way.

Highlight the helpful features of the product you’re promoting to
describe a brighter future for your readers instead.

**Focus on the product, not the person.**

-  **Before:** Many developers *get overwhelmed* by system maintenance.
   Technology X minimizes maintenance issues, *so it’s not so hard for
   you.*
-  **After:** Complicated system maintenance hinders your development.
   Technology X minimizes maintenance issues, so that you can focus on
   your work.

**Don’t write negative copy or FUD (fear, uncertainty, and
doubt/disinformation)**

-  **Before** (example from a podcast ad): “If you’re still using TECH
   X, you’re wasting your time.”
-  **After (theoretical):** “Switching to TECH Y, can double your
   deployment frequency, leaving you time to do other important things.”
   [Of course, we need to be able to prove that claim.]
