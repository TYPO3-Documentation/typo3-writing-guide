Accessibility
=============

We rely on the Stanford University IT `Office of Digital Accessibility
resources <https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/guides>`__ for
guidance on accessible language. Be mindful of readers depending on
screen readers or other assistive devices.

.. _1-images:

Images
~~~~~~

Describe images using alternative text (alt-text) or caption.

-  Be accurate, specific, and concise: use 125 characters or fewer,
   while providing a meaningful description of the image.
-  You don’t need to take up valuable characters with, “photo of,” or
   “image of.” Assistive technologies will announce when they are
   describing an image.

The Stanford University IT Office of Digital Accessibility has some
great tips and more information on
their `Images <https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/images>`__ page.
Amy Leak has a good `Medium
article <https://medium.com/@amyalexandraleak/should-you-use-alt-text-or-a-caption-48311e259ded>`__ on
the different applications of alt-text and captions.

-  **Alt-text - Before:** Photo of man in a room full of art supplies
   and tools.
-  **Alt-text - After:** Dr. Seuss faces forward in art studio
-  **Caption:** Dr. Seuss explains his painting methods

Hyperlinks
~~~~~~~~~~

**Use descriptive text for links.** Never use “click here”. The purpose
of the link should be obvious from the link text. The Stanford
University IT Office of Digital Accessibility explains it well on
their `Hyperlinks <https://uit.stanford.edu/accessibility/concepts/hyperlinks>`__ page.

-  **Before:** Click here to find out more about our company.
-  **After:** Find out more on the Meet the Team page.

**Use links as calls to action.** When we want our readers to take
action, convert, move to the next stage in the funnel, read the next
blog post in a series, we use a link with a clear call-to-action. Tempt
the reader by promising something new on the other side of the click.
Calls-to-actions take the reader to a different piece of content. Use
them anywhere where you want the reader to click.

-  Get in touch to `book a demo <http://example.com>`__ !
-  `Contact us <http://example.com>`__ with your project needs today!
-  `See how much you would save <http://example.com>`__ by switching to
   the Peanut-Matic-5000!
-  Start your journey to `a more peanut-filled
   life <http://example.com>`__ today.

**Use links as citations or sources.** We use links to other sources for
various reasons in online content. When we need to provide access to
some information but hope that our readers won’t leave our page, we
spell out the information in the link. Telling the reader what they’ll
find behind the link makes clicking it redundant—a “don’t click me” link
that keeps the reader on the page. Use citational links to back up a
claim or offer background and context. They should not address readers
directly.

-  Nine out of ten dental professionals `say they prefer
   peanuts <http://example.com>`__ .
-  Case studies are `the second most popular content asset with B2B
   content
   marketers <https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018_B2B_Research_FINAL.pdf>`__ .
-  `73% of BSB
   marketers <https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2018_B2B_Research_FINAL.pdf>`__ use
   case studies in their content marketing.
