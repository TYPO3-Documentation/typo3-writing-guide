As community members coming together, we have different backgrounds and
experiences, but many of us have had little or less than ideal writing
or editing experiences. Traditionally, communication from editors may be
minimal, cryptic, or nonexistent.

**We strive to communicate, connect, and grow by applying empathy,
producing clarity, and building trust.**

We aim to approach the writing and editing process objectively and
professionally (and passionately, positively!) and stay excited to learn
along the way. To this end, we give each other (and ourselves!)
constructive feedback in a constructive manner and receive it in that
spirit—constructively!

**We’re peers learning from peers.**

Our writing and editing methodology serves several purposes:

#. **Make us better writers.** We can learn from the edits made on our
   work, repeat the good, improve the rest.
#. **Make us better editors.** Being transparent and sharing the
   reasoning behind changes we suggest helps us be more systematic,
   methodical, and communicative.

**Help everyone communicate better.** Inspired by open source philosophy
and practice, we share our tips, methodology, tools, and processes with
others.
