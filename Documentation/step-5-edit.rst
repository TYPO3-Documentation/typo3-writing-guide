Step 5: Edit
============

Editing is an iterative process: draft, review, improve, repeat. We
approach it as a conversation and learning opportunity between peers.

**Self-review:** Review your own work before sending it to others.
Download the `Grammarly.com <https://www.grammarly.com/>`__ extension
and run a check on your work.

**Format piece for publication:** Use H1 formatting for the title, H2
for subheadings, and “normal text” for body text. Make sure hyperlinks
are correctly formatted and bold and italic formatting is applied
consistently.

**Early peer feedback:** If you’re stuck on where things should go, need
more input or inspiration, submit something for a review when you’re
only partially done. Tell the reviewer the state it is in (e.g., “I
think this is about half done,” or “I am stuck on this point”), and the
reviewer won’t be poking at grammar and polish issues but can give some
feedback on bigger issues like structure, concepts, and so on.

**TYPO3 internal review:** Once you’re happy with your draft, submit it
to a TYPO3 community editor for review. You can “review the review” and
make edits before submitting the piece for Publication. This stage may
also include:

-  **Quote approval:** Mark up any direct quotes explicitly and check
   with the speaker to get their approval. We generally share the full
   document in Google Docs with the speaker and comment on their quotes
   to “assign” reviews to individuals.
-  **Technical/legal review:** You may need to submit the content for a
   technical or legal review during the draft stage. Make sure the
   reviewer knows whether the content has been copyedited or polished
   already.
