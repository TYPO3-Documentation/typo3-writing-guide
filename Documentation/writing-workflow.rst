When you need to produce content regularly, you can’t always rely on
inspiration to hit when you need it. Trust in processes over creativity.

| We use a transparent, systematic method to prepare, write, and edit
  content. Our structured approach to writing and editing gives clear
  guidance to writers, removing the fear factor of the blank page.
| *(The specifics on the TYPO3 Content Workflow and how to submit and
  contribute are coming in the next section.)*

A quick note on tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We create drafts in Google Docs. Use *Editing* mode in Google Docs when
drafting a piece. When reviewing or editing someone else’s work, use
comments to provide feedback and make suggestions for improvement using
*Suggesting* mode so the writer can track your changes.
