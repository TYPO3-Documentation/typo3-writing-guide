Values
~~~~~~

The TYPO3 Project is an open source community, a tech product, a
business organization, and all the individuals involved in TYPO3—and our
values correspond to every aspect of our identity. In the spirit of open
source, we developed this set of values as a community.

**Human Values**

-  **Contribution**: Our product would not exist or improve without our
   contributors. Every individual who contributes shapes TYPO3’s DNA,
   and we value all kinds of contributions—technical and otherwise.
-  **Community:** As a community, we support, inspire, and share
   knowledge with one another. Our community’s successes are shared
   successes.
-  **Respect:** Our inclusive community respects all of its members,
   regardless of our backgrounds. We treat each other respectfully, with
   openness and trust.
-  **Collaboration:** An Open Source environment is characterized by
   collaboration within, between, and beyond teams. We collaborate and
   support one another in all our initiatives.
-  **Enjoy what you do:** We strive to create a fun environment,
   strengthened by bonds of friendship. It’s important that our
   community enjoys working with TYPO3.

**Tech Values**

-  **Security:** Because our users have entrusted us with their CMS
   needs, we honor their trust by treating security as a top priority.
-  **Quality of code:** We maintain high-quality, well-documented, and
   clean code that adheres to the latest standards so future
   contributors can understand how TYPO3 works and continue to improve
   it.
-  **The product is more than code:** Software is not an end in itself;
   everything we do is in service of improving the daily experience of
   our users and community.
-  **Meaningful innovation:** We don’t innovate just to innovate. Our
   improvements are sourced from community and user needs— they solve
   real problems.
-  **Sharing knowledge:** Our product’s future is sustained by knowledge
   sharing, mentorship, and support. We share our know-how because it
   makes our product better.

**Business and Leadership Values**

-  **Strong, clear communication:** Transparent and open communication
   foster the community’s health and growth. We strive to create an
   accessible environment in which everyone can stay informed and ask
   questions.
-  **Reliability:** We take our responsibilities seriously and follow
   through on our commitments. Our community, members, and users know
   they can rely on us.
-  **Fair business models:** We support sustainable and fair business
   models underpinned by our free and open source CMS. Our services and
   products are priced fairly for the quality and services provided.
-  **Constructive feedback:** We provide meaningful, constructive
   feedback to make TYPO3 better. All feedback should serve the ultimate
   goal of improving TYPO3 and supporting individual development.
-  **Mentorship:** Our community grows and learns through mentorship. By
   sharing knowledge and supporting our newer members, we foster the
   development of individuals and TYPO3 itself.

These values should inform our purpose, how we want to present ourselves
in the broader open source community and technology world, how we make
decisions, and where we focus our contributions.

These values also shape our culture, behavior, and community
leadership—providing a set of guiding principles that we hold each other
accountable to.
